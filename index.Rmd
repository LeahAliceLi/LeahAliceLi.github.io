## Hello! I'm Leah Li, and this is my website, 

Iâ€™m a Master of Public Health student in **Biostatistics Department** at **Columbia University**.  I'm most passionate about **data and analysis**. 

**P8105 Data Science** is my most favorite course in my program at Columbia.

This site demonstrates my academic work, professional experience, and ongoing projects.
